\section{Lecture 9: Kernel, tournaments and king}

\subsection{Kernel in a directed graph}

Is a set of vertices $S \subseteq V(D)$ such that $S$ indicates no edges and every vertex outsied of S has a succssor in $S$. Concept of kernel is only defined for directed graph. 
% Here's a citation~\cite{Kar84a}.

\paragraph{Example 1:}Let us suppose we take a graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges which are in cycle. Kernel of this directed graph $ S_1 = \{1, 3\}$ which are not connected to each other. Similarly $ S_2 = \{2, 4\}$ is also a kernel, so there is no unique kernel in this case.
\myfig{.375}{graph_img1_BW.png}{Directed Graph to show kernels.}{fig:Directed Graph}

\paragraph{Example 2:}Let us suppose we take a graph with 4 vertices and 3 edges which are in cycle. Kernel of this directed graph $ S = \{2, 4\}$ which are not connected to each other. 
\myfig{.375}{graph_img2_BW.png}{Directed Graph to show kernels.}{fig:Directed Graph}

\paragraph{Example 3:}Let us suppose we take a graph with 6 vertices and 6 edges which are in cycle. Kernel of this directed graph $ S_1 = \{2, 4, 5\}$ , $ S_2 = \{1, 3, 6\}$ which are not connected to each other. 
\myfig{.375}{graph_img3_BW.png}{Directed Graph to show kernels.}{fig:Directed Graph}

\paragraph{Example 4:}For a complete graph kernel will be null. 
\myfig{.375}{graph_img4_BW.png}{Fully connected directed graph.}{fig:Directed Graph}

\paragraph{Example 5:}A graph with odd cycles will not have kernel. $ C_n$ where n is odd will not have kernel because we need to choose something in $ S $ to make a kernel and whatever you choose should be chosen a way such that they should be independent and successor of $ S $. In this case every node has only one successor hence if you dont choose any node then we have to choose its successor and simply put we can never have a scenario where kernel can be created.
\myfig{.375}{graph_img5_BW.png}{Directed graph}{fig:Directed Graph}

Let $ K $ be the kernel of $C_n$, then any $u,v \in K$ should have the following properties 

\begin{itemize}
    \item they should be independent;
    \item $ w \in K$ then $w$ must have successor in $K$
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Outdegree and indegree}

Every node in directed graph will have a indegree and outdegree. Number of edges comming into and going out of the graph. 

In any directed graph sum of indegrees = sum of all degrees = number of edges in G i.e. \begin{equation}
    {\textstyle \sum_{v \in V(G)}} d^+(v) = {\textstyle \sum_{v \in V(G)}}  d^-(v) = {\textstyle \mid e(G) \mid}
 \end{equation}

\paragraph{Example 1:}For the given digram indegree and outdegree of each node would be\begin{itemize}
    \item $Outdegree$: For node $A$, $d^+(A) = 1$, For node $B$, $d^+(B) = 1$ 
    \item $Indegree$: For node $A$, $d^-(A) = 0$, For node $B$, $d^-(B) = 2$ 
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Orientation}

An orientation of graph $G$ is a directed graph $D$ obtained from $G$ by choosing an orientation $ x \to y$ or $y \to x$ for each edge $xy \in E(G) $. 

\myfig{.375}{graph_img9_BW.png}{Undirected to Directed graph}{fig:Directed graph to find in/out degree}
 
 
\subsection{Tournament in graph}
is an orientation of a complete graph. 

\subsection{King of the tournament}
King of the tournament is a vertex from where all the other vertices are reachable by a path of length of 2 at most.

\paragraph{Example 1:}Let us suppose we have a cricket tournament between different countries and graph should have directions. It can be assumed that $x \to y$ plays a match and $x$ wins against $y$. In the given example India is the king because all nodes can be reached from India.
\myfig{.375}{graph_img10_BW.png}{King of the tournament}{fig:Directed graph to find in/out degree}

\paragraph{Example 2:}A complete graph with 5 vertices and vertices to each other. All vertices are kings because they satisfy the definition of the king.
For node $B$
\begin{itemize}
    \item $B \to C$
    \item $B \to D \to A$
    \item $B \to D $
    \item $B \to D \to E$
    \end{itemize}
\myfig{.375}{graph_img11_BW.png}{King of the tournament}{fig:Directed graph to find in/out degree}

\paragraph{Every tournament has a king.}This can be proved with a contradiction. Suppose $u$ is a node with the highest outgoing degree. 
\begin{equation}
    {\textstyle N_o(u) +  N_I(u) + 1 = \mid V(G) \mid} 
 \end{equation} where $u$ is not a king.

Suppose $u$ is not the king. All the nodes is $N_I$ will be connected to all the nodes in $N_o$ and only thing we are not aware of is the direction.
\paragraph{Case 1:}If the direction is from $N_I \gets N_o$, then we can say that $u$ is king because we can reach from all the nodes of $N_I$ via just two edges $ u \to N_o \to N_I$. Hence every tournament must have a king.
\paragraph{Case 2:}If the firection is from $N_I \to N_o$. Lets suppose there is a node in $v$ in $N_I(u)$ and $v$ has outgoing edges in all the nodes i.e. $ v \to N_o$ and $ v \to u$. Number of outgoing edge of node $v$ = $1 + \mid N_o(u)\mid >$ number of outgong edge of $u$. This is a contradiction because we have assumed that $u$ is the node which has highest out degree. Hence this case is not applicable.

\myfig{.375}{graph_img12_BW.png}{King of the tournament}{fig:Directed graph to find in/out degree}


\begin{theorem} Prove or disprove if $D$ is a orientation of simple graph with 5 vertices then the vertices of $D$ cannot have distinct out degree.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We can create a graph where $x > y$ then $y \to x$ as below. In this way outegree of each of node \begin{itemize}
    \item $Node(1) = 4$ 
    \item $Node(2) = 3$ 
    \item $Node(3) = 2$
    \item $Node(4) = 1$
\end{itemize}
Hence the statement given in false because $D$ can have distinct outdegree.
\myfig{.375}{graph_img13_BW.png}{Example of simple graph}{fig:Directed graph to find in/out degree}
\end{proof}


\paragraph{Question}Give example of one real world realtion whose digraphs has no cycles.
\myfig{.375}{graph_img14_BW.png}{Real world example}{fig:Directed graph to find in/out degree}


\subsection{Tree}
In context of directed graph we can define a tree such that if we take any two vertices we will have a unique path between those two vertices. Simply put trees are connected acyclic graphs.

\myfig{.375}{graph_img15_BW.png}{Example of tree}{fig:Directed graph to find in/out degree}

\paragraph{Properties of trees}\begin{itemize}
    \item Deleting a leaf from an $n$-vertex tree produces an $n-1$ vertex tree.
    \item Tree is connected and it has no cycle.
    \item An $n$ vertex contains $n-1$ edges because if it contains one more it will have a cycle and if it has one less it will not be connected. 
    \item For any pair of vertex $(u, v)$ there exists one and only one path.
    \item Every edge of a tree is cut-edge.
    \item Tree is a bipartite graph.
\end{itemize}

\section{Lecture 10: Common definitions}

\subsection{Distance in a graph}
If graph $G$ has a $u-v$ path, then the distance between $u$ to $v$ is written as $d(u-v)$ is the least length of $u-v$ path. This distance is the shortest distance. For the given graph
\begin{equation}
    {\textstyle d(u,v) = 1} 
 \end{equation}
Similarly,
\begin{equation}
    {\textstyle d(u,w) = \infty} 
 \end{equation}
\myfig{.375}{graph_img16_BW.png}{Example of tree}{fig:distance of graph}

\subsection{Diameteter of a graph}
is the maximum of distanes between any two pair's of vertices.
Diameter of graph Figure~\ref{fig:distance of graph}. is $\infty$

\subsection{Eccentricity}
of a vertex $u$ is the maximum distance it has with any node in the graph.

\subsection{Radius}
denoted as $rad(G)$ is the minimum of eccentricity of all the nodes.


\paragraph{Example 1:}For the given graph in ~\ref{fig:value_find1}\begin{itemize}
    \item $d(B,K) = 4$
    \item Diameter of the graph $Dia(G) = 4$
    \item Eccentricity $e(A,B,D,E) = 4$, $e(F) = 2$, $e(C,G,H,I) = 3$, $e(I,J,K,L) = 4$.
    \item Radius $rad(G) = 2$ 
\end{itemize}
\myfig{.375}{graph_img17_BW.png}{King of the tournament}{fig:value_find1}

\paragraph{Example 2:}For the given graph in ~\ref{fig:value_find2} \begin{itemize}
    \item $d(A,B) = 1$, $d(A,C) = 2$, $d(A,D) = 3$, $d(A,E) = 2$, $d(A,F) = 3$. 
    \item Diameter of the graph $Dia(G) = 3$.
    \item Eccentricity $e(A,B,C,D,E,F) = 3$.
    \item Radius $rad(G) = 3$ 
\end{itemize}
\myfig{.375}{graph_img18_BW.png}{King of the tournament}{fig:value_find2}


\begin{theorem} If $G$ is a simple graph then $diam(G) \geq 3$ implies $diam(G^c) \leq 3$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$diam(G) \geq 3$ refers to the fact that there are some nodes that do not share neighbours.

\begin{equation}
    {\textstyle \exists u,v \in V(G)}
 \end{equation}  s.t. they do not have common neighbour in $G$. This is because if they have a common neighbour then they can be reached by just two nodes i.e. their diameter will never be greater than 3. Hence structure ~\ref{fig:theoram2} does not exists in G.
\myfig{.375}{graph_img19_BW.png}{}{fig:theoram2}

Also,
\begin{equation}
    {\textstyle \exists u,v \in V(G^c)}
\end{equation} s.t. they have a common neighbour in $G$ and $u,v$ are non adjacent.
\end{proof}


\paragraph{Problem:}Computer diameter and radius of $K_{m,n}$ \begin{itemize}
    \item Eceentricity of each node $E(A) = 2$ and $E(B) = 2$ 
    \item $diam(K_{m,n}) = 2 $
    \item $rad(K_{m,n}) = 2 $
\end{itemize}
